        <p>
            In this experiment, I have explored jQuery Accordion&nbsp;feature.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&#39;ve added the jQuery and jQueryUI. Also, I have added Bootstrap to style the page.
        </p>
        <div>
            <strong>&lt;script src=&quot;//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>&lt;script src=&quot;//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>&lt;link href=&quot;//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
            A &lt;div&gt; with the id &#39;accordion&#39; is created. Inside this &lt;div&gt;, I have created three &lt;div&gt; tags for each of the content to be displayed in the&nbsp;accordion.
        </div>
        <div>
            &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>&lt;div id=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>&lt;/div&gt;</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
            &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
            This id is grabbed by the jQuery function and applied the accordian style. Also, the collapsible is set to true to enable accordian collapse.
